Termed and the server with it, can't be asked to finish this project so here is the source. Don't know what patch it was last updated too

Driver is a code cave IOCTL driver that hijacks a system driver's boot section that work's with memory and storage manipulation, it does not have any CR3 EOS decryption like route trashing and CR3 DTB decrypting (mean's you can't skid with it on EAC). I haven't finished the loader and if you try to use the client to server it won't work since I host it from my PC. The source has my GetPlayerViewPoint hook for silent aim and view angles for memory aim, most of you won't be able to figure out how to use the driver to hook and etc but I might release a example on it
